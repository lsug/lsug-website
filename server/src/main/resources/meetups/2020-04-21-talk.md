# Jon Pretty: TBC

We're delighted to hear from Jon Pretty.  Watch this space to find out what he'll be speaking about.

# Nicolas Rinaudo : Far more than you've ever wanted to know about ADTs

Algebraic Data Types are a simple yet surprisingly powerful concept, and one that all developers should be comfortable with.

This talk intends to motivate them, explain some of the theory behind them, and tackle their generalised form, GADTs.
