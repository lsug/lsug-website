◊description{
◊p{
Christmas is long gone, but it's never too late to celebrate functional programming. And there's no better way to celebrate than by solving the Advent of Code.
}
◊p{
Join us and have a crack at the first three advent of code challenges. Starting with pure functions, recursion, collections and error handling, we'll work our way up to using functional libraries such as ◊link{◊text{cats}◊url{https://index.scala-lang.org/typelevel/cats}}, ◊link{◊text{spire}◊url{https://index.scala-lang.org/typelevel/spire}}, ◊link{◊text{monocle}◊url{https://index.scala-lang.org/julien-truffaut/monocle}} and ◊link{◊text{fs2}◊url{https://index.scala-lang.org/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2}}.
}
}
◊setup{
◊p{This workshop requires a fair amount of dependencies, so try your best to set up before you arrive. You can set up by cloning the ◊link{◊text{GitHub repository}◊url{https://github.com/lsug/advent-of-code-typelevel.git}} and following the instructions on the README.

◊p{Don’t hesitate to reach out to the Gitter channel if you have any problems.}
