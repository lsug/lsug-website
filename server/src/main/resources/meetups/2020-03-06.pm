◊description{
◊p{
Christmas is long gone, but it's never too late to celebrate functional programming. And there's no better way to celebrate than by solving the Advent of Code.
}
◊p{
Join us and have a crack at the first three advent of code challenges. Starting with pure functions, recursion, collections and error handling, we'll work our way up to using functional libraries such as ◊scaladex{◊org{typelevel}◊repo{cats}}, ◊scaladex{◊org{typelevel}◊repo{spire}}, ◊scaladex{◊org{optics-dev}◊repo{monocle}} and ◊scaladex{◊org{typelevel}◊repo{fs2}}.
}
}
◊setup{
◊p{This workshop requires a fair amount of dependencies, so try your best to set up before you arrive. You can set up by cloning the ◊link{◊text{GitHub repository}◊url{https://github.com/lsug/advent-of-code-typelevel.git}} and following the instructions on the README.
}
◊p{Don’t hesitate to reach out to the Gitter channel if you have any problems.}
