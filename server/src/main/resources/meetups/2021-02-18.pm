◊description{
◊p{
Optics is a popular topic among library authors; they exist in at
least four flavours in Scala:
◊scaladex{◊org{optics-dev}◊repo{Monocle}},
◊scaladex{◊org{softwaremill}◊repo{Quicklens}},
◊scaladex{◊org{milessabin}◊repo{Shapeless}} and
◊scaladex{◊org{tinkoffcreditsystems}◊repo{Tofu}} . However, we rarely
see optics in real world code bases. Why is that? Why are optics not
popular in Scala?
}
◊p{
In this talk, I plan to not only answer this question, but also offer some solutions to the current problems with Monocle API.

This presentation is a longer, more in-depth version of the one I gave
last year at ◊link{◊url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT3tNV0xfbE}◊text{Scale by the Bay}}
