◊name{MUnit: your new favorite Scala testing library?}
◊speakers{gabriele-petronella}
◊tags{Scala,TDD,testing}
◊time{18:00-18:30}
◊description{
◊p{◊scaladex{◊org{scalameta}◊repo{MUnit}} is a testing library for
Scala built. “Another one?!”, you may say? In this talk we’ll explore
together the most notable features of MUnit and see what makes this
little library unique!}
◊p{
Via a series of live code examples, we’ll answers questions like “Why
does MUnit not have a DSL?”, “How do we integrate MUnit with other
libraries?” and “How can MUnit help dealing with flaky tests?”.
}

◊p{At the end the presentation, MUnit may become your new favorite
testing library!}

◊event{
◊name{Time-warping in tests with Cats Effect}
◊speakers{jacob-wang}
◊tags{Scala,testing,cats-effect}
◊time{18:45-19:45}
◊description{
◊p{
How do you test time‑sensitive application logic? In this talk, we
will explore what lives under ExecutionContext and
cats.effect.Timer and how these abstractions allow us to “warp”
forward in time. Armed with our new knowledge, we will then look at
how time‑sensitive tests are structured to make them fast and
reliable.
}
◊p{This talk uses ◊scaladex{◊org{typelevel}◊repo{cats-effect}} in its
examples but a lot of the concepts are shared across all effect
libraries in Scala, so if you use ZIO or even just plain Scala
Futures, you too can learn the secrets behind time-warping and perform
the magic yourself :)
