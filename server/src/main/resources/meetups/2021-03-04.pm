◊p{◊scaladex{◊org{scalameta}◊repo{MUnit}} is a testing library for
Scala built. “Another one?!”, you may say? In this talk we’ll explore
together the most notable features of MUnit and see what makes this
little library unique!}
◊p{
Via a series of live code examples, we’ll answers questions like “Why
does MUnit not have a DSL?”, “How do we integrate MUnit with other
libraries?” and “How can MUnit help dealing with flaky tests?”.
}

◊p{At the end the presentation, MUnit may become your new favorite testing library!}
