# Jacob Wang: Practical Type Safety

What is type safety? Why should we care? What techniques are possible to improve type safety in my Scala code? should I use them?

Whether you're a beginner or already familiar with Scala,
this part-philosophical, part-practical will empower you to write better code, and be happier writing them too!

# Lucio Biondi: Authentication & role-based authorisation for http4s microservices

While developing REST micro-services, and http4s is a good choice to this end, one of the many challenges every team has to face with sooner or later is how to control access to the resources the system provides. This is of course a sensitive topic from a security standpoint, so public and complete implementations from which to draw inspiration are not easily found on the Web.
